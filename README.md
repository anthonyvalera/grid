This 'grid' is a barebones grid system for your projects. It weighs less than 2kb and provides very basic column/grid/row support.
The main break is set at 768px, at which point, the grid falls back to single rowed columns.

Add minified version to the top of your css file or include the partial grid.scss in your sass files.
Feel free to add/contribute. It's something I've used locally and created for small projects.
