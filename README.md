# grid

## Features ##

This 'grid' is a barebones grid system for your projects. It weighs less than 2kb and provides very basic column/grid/row support.
The main break is set at 768px, at which point, the grid falls back to single column rows.

**Columns** are defined like `col-4` and should always be wrapped in a `row`.
**Containers** wrap content into smaller breakpoints based on viewport (good for centering content).

You can set column offsets like `off-3` where the number is the amount of columns you're moving over.

The standard padding (gutter) between columns is 15px. This gives each row -15px margin on each side.

## Directions ##
Add minified version to the top of your css file or include the partial _grid.scss in your scss files.
