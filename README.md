This 'grid' is a barebones grid system for your projects. It weighs less than 2kb and provides very basic column/grid/row support.
The main break is set at 768px, at which point, the grid falls back to single column rows.

### Directions ##
Add minified version to the top of your css file or include the partial _grid.scss in your sass files.
